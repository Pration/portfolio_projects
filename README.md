### Introduction

Embark on a captivating journey into the heart of Cyclistic's bike-share analysis. As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, we'll navigate data intricacies and collaborate with diverse team members.

Prepare to dive into the dynamic process of data analysis: from asking questions to sharing insights. Cyclistic's data will reveal narratives, patterns, and solutions â€“ turning numbers into compelling stories.

### Scenario

I step into the role of a junior data analyst in Cyclistic's marketing team. Our goal? Maximizing annual memberships by understanding how casual riders and members use Cyclistic bikes differently. With data-driven insights, we'll craft a compelling marketing strategy. Meet the characters:

- Cyclistic: An inclusive bike-share program with diverse riders.
- Lily Moreno: Director of marketing.
- Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team: Guiding marketing strategy.
- Cyclistic Executive Team: Decision-makers.

### Stage 1: Ask

Three key questions shape our marketing program:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I'm tasked with the first question: How do annual members and casual riders differ in bike usage? My deliverables include a report containing:

1. Clear business task statement.
2. Data source description.
3. Data cleaning/manipulation documentation.
4. Summary of analysis.
5. Visualizations and findings.
6. Top three recommendations.
